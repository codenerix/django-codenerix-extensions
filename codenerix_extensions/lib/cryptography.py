# This library is intended for encrypting as CODENERIX's Cryptography Libraries work, the basis
# for the library to work are, the KEY is always a SHA256 from your real KEY, the IV vector
# should be generated automatically on encryption time by the library and must be inserted
# at the beginning of the encrypted string (which shoul be padded with PKCS7). The full
# string IV+ENCRYPTED is encoded to Base64. For decrypting the process is the opossite, the
# raw string is decoded from Base64, the first 16 bytes are taken as the IV and the rest as
# the encrypted string, the key is hashed with SHA256 and then the encrypted string is decrypted
# using the IV and the hashed key.
